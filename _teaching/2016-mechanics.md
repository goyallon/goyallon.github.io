**Course:** Continuum Mechanics  
**Instructor:** Emile Roux  
**Description:** This course provided a comprehensive overview of continuum mechanics, covering both static and dynamic aspects. Topics included stress and strain analysis, deformation theories, material behavior under various loading conditions, and dynamic responses to forces and moments. The course aimed to develop a deep understanding of how materials and structures behave under different mechanical scenarios.
