collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-04-23-patent-4
excerpt: " The invention relates to a shoulder prosthesis comprising a diaphyseal part extending along a diaphyseal axis and on which an epiphyseal part is mounted, the epiphyseal part having an upper face which is inclined along a front plane with respect to the diaphyseal axis, and a lower central face bearing against a complementary upper face of the diaphyseal part. According to the invention, the epiphyseal part is reversible by rotation through 180° about an axis normal to the lower central face bearing against the epiphyseal part to modify the inclination of the upper face of the epiphyseal part."
